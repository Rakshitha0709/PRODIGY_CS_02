# PRODIGY_CS_02 - Image Encryption using Pixel Manipulation

## üîê Project Overview
This project is part of my **Cyber Security Internship at Prodigy InfoTech**.  
The task was to **develop a simple image encryption tool** using pixel manipulation.  
Users can **encrypt** and **decrypt** images by applying a mathematical operation to pixel values.
